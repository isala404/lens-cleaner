# Terms and Conditions

**Last Updated:** November 2025

Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using the TopPics Chrome Extension and associated services (the "Service") operated by **Tallisa** ("us", "we", or "our").

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or downloading the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.

## 2. Description of Service

Tallisa provides "TopPics," a software tool designed to assist users in organizing their Google Photos library.

*   **Free Service**: Operates 100% locally within your browser using WebAssembly and local AI models to identify duplicates and similar photos.
*   **Premium Service ("Auto-Select")**: Utilizes cloud-based AI processing to recommend the best photos from a group.

## 3. Payments, Refunds, and Disputes

### 3.1. Payment Processing
Payments for premium features are processed securely via **Polar.sh**, our merchant of record. Tallisa does not store your financial information (credit card numbers, bank details).

### 3.2. Refund Policy
We strive for fairness but must protect our business from abuse. By using the Service, you agree to the following refund terms:

*   **Eligible for Refund**: You are entitled to a full refund if a technical error occurs **during the processing phase** that prevents the delivery of results (e.g., the AI fails to analyze your photos, or the system crashes before results are returned). Please contact **support@tallisa.dev** with your Job ID.
*   **NOT Eligible for Refund**:
    *   **Service Rendered**: Once the AI analysis is complete and results are presented to you, the service is considered fully rendered and consumed.
    *   **Action Taken**: If you utilize the tool to "clear," "delete," or "organize" photos based on our recommendations, you explicitly acknowledge that the service provided value and was successfully utilized. No refunds will be issued after photos have been processed or deleted.
    *   **User Dissatisfaction with Subjective Choices**: The Auto-Select feature uses AI to make subjective decisions about photo quality. Disagreement with the AI's specific choice (e.g., preferring photo A over photo B) does not constitute a failure of service, provided the system functioned as described.

### 3.3. Dispute Resolution and Chargebacks
**Attempting to initiate a payment dispute or chargeback for a successfully rendered service is a violation of these Terms.**

*   We reserve the right to dispute any chargeback claims by providing the payment provider with evidence of service delivery (including server logs of successful AI processing, result delivery timestamps, and subsequent user actions).
*   Users who submit fraudulent disputes or chargebacks may be permanently banned from all Tallisa products and services.

## 4. User Responsibilities & Data Safety

**TopPics is a decision-support tool.**

*   **You Are the Final Decision Maker**: The AI provides *suggestions*. You are responsible for reviewing these suggestions before confirming any deletions.
*   **No Liability for Data Loss**: Tallisa is not responsible for any accidental deletion, loss, corruption, or alteration of your photos or data. By using the Service, you acknowledge that you are modifying your personal data and assume all associated risks.
*   **Backups**: We strongly recommend maintaining an independent backup of your Google Photos library before performing bulk deletions.

## 5. Intellectual Property

The Service and its original content (excluding user-uploaded photos), features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of Tallisa and its licensors.

## 6. Third-Party Services

*   **Google Photos**: We are not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to Google LLC. "Google Photos" is a trademark of Google LLC.
*   **Links**: Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by Tallisa. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party web sites or services.

## 7. Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Tallisa and its licensee and licensors, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers, and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees), resulting from or arising out of a) your use and access of the Service, or b) a breach of these Terms.

## 8. Limitation of Liability

In no event shall Tallisa, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.
