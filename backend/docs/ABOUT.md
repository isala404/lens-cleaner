# TopPics: Privacy-First Photo Organization

**Declutter your Google Photos library with intelligent, local AI.**

TopPics helps you rediscover your best memories by removing duplicates, blurry shots, and accidental captures—all without your private photos ever leaving your browser.

## Why TopPics?

Managing thousands of photos is overwhelming. Storage space runs out, and finding that one perfect shot in a burst of twenty takes forever. We built TopPics to solve this.

*   **100% Local Analysis**: We use WebAssembly to run powerful AI models directly on your device. Your photos stay private.
*   **Smart Grouping**: Our AI "sees" your photos like a human does, grouping similar shots based on content, not just timestamps.
*   **You Are In Control**: We never delete automatically. You review every suggestion.

## Key Features

### 🔒 Privacy First
Our core philosophy is simple: **Your photos are none of our business.**
Standard scanning and grouping happen entirely offline in your browser. We don't see your photos, we don't track your memories, and we don't sell your data.

### ⚡ Lightning Fast
Built with modern web technologies, TopPics scans thousands of photos in minutes, helping you free up gigabytes of storage space on Google Photos.

### 🎯 Auto-Select (Premium)
For the ultimate decluttering experience, our optional **Auto-Select** feature uses advanced cloud AI to identify:
*   The sharpest, best-focused shots.
*   Everyone with eyes open and smiling.
*   The best composition in a series.

*Note: Premium processing is ephemeral. Photos are analyzed and immediately deleted from our servers.*
